Project Description

This weather forecast application is built using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript, with data fetched from the OpenWeatherMap API. Users can search weather details by city name or fetch weather information for their current location using the Geolocation API.

The application displays current weather conditions including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather status. It also shows a 5-day weather forecast using card-based layouts. Recently searched cities are stored and displayed using localStorage, allowing quick access to previous searches.

The interface includes dedicated layouts for both desktop and mobile views, ensuring proper alignment, readability, and usability across different screen sizes. Invalid city inputs are handled through custom UI error messages instead of browser alerts, and the visuals dynamically update based on different weather conditions.
